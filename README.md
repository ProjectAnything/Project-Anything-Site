Site for the Century HS Project Anything club initiative.

# We are Project Anything
  Our purpose is to spread Technological Literacy to kids and students in the local community.
We create programs, machines, and technological devices to showcase and teach the community.
We are glad to help the students and local community, it means a lot and gives us great experiences.

# What is our Main Goal?
	We hope to expand this club across the district and begin to have a solid influence on the next generation and be able to teach them more about technology! We hope to have our own events/showcases and have a following large enough to spread across Minnesota!

# How do we Achieve this Purpose?
  We will achieve our purpose with our members creating programs, machines, and technological devices to showcase and teach the community. Possible creations that we will be working on are magic mirrors, raspberry pis, machine learning programs, 3D printing applications, gaming programs, web-design, human controlled bots, and all kinds of ambitious, fun projects! After we create these projects, we will showcase these at all types of events from middle school summits to high school meetings and to even the Google competition or Minnehack!

# How Much Coverage would you get from these Showcases?
	From the competitions such as Minnehack or Google Science fair we could get thousands of people to view us and learn more about our goals! At the more local, school based showcases we would get around 400-1000 people at each event as many of these showcases are to multiple schools. At these showcases students will get to learn even more in depth and understand our goals at a higher level.
